# Autoencoder-for-time-series-data
*This repo is a simple autoencoder build for handling time series data.
*This repo implements a simple convolutional autoencoder.
*The dataset used here in this sample is from UCI HAR dataset "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset"
*The notebook contains preprocessing of the data and feeding the data into the network
*you can train the network and evalute your model.


This code can be further extended for some unsupervised segmentation of the time series data.
Since you will already extract the features from the autoencoder you can try out some distance metrics to find the transition in the data and identify those break points.
